It harnesses the spiritual and universal energies within music videos to elevate your state of consciousness through the Law of Resonance."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="It took us years to begin to understand why we were seeing results such as anti-aging, increase in charisma, massive increase of self-confidence and development of clairvoyance, so explaining &quot;how&quot; it works is beyond the scope of this introduction."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="This software makes your grounding sessions a lot easier by playing the right videos in the right sequence to gradually increase or decrease the intensity, or to attune to specific energies you want to strengthen. The sequencing decisions are based on precise readings of the energetic frequencies contained within each video."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="This is not just watching videos. This is hardcore energy work. The results won't make sense at first."/><LineBreak/><Run/><LineBreak/><Run Text="Because many of the best grounding resources have to be purchased in low-quality VCD or DVD format, this software includes a Media Encoder that really does magic to upscale VCDs and DVDs to 720p or 768p. You have to see it to believe it. I don't like to compromise."/></TextBlock>
